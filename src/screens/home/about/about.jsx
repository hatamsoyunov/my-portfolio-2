            In 2019 I graduated from the university with a degree in marketing. Also, completed additional courses in
            Internet marketing, marketing in web design and UI/UX design. Knowledge of UI/UX, in conjunction with
            marketing, helped me develop selling websites and help in recent years to add/suggest UI/UX improvements to
            projects in which I participate.
